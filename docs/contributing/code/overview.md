# Code Changes Overview

Welcome to the code changes section! As a contributor, it's essential to understand the project's goals and adhere to its code of conduct. Before contributing, please review any existing issues related to your work, ensure your code is well-documented, and has adequate test coverage. It's also important that your code is compatible with the project's supported platforms and their versions.

Our collaborative workflow is simple:

1. **Identify an Issue:** If not exists already, create an issue for new features or bug reports, outlining your proposal or the identified problem.
2. **Propose a Solution:** Open a pull request with a proposed solution to the issue. On complex issues, it's recommended to discuss your approach with the community and maintainers before submitting a PR.
3. **Engage in Review:** A collaborator will review your pull request. Reviews from other contributors are also encouraged.
4. **Merge and Release:** After the review, a collaborator will merge your contribution, typically releasing it in the next version of the project.

We use [GitHub] for managing pull requests, conducting code reviews, and tracking issues.

The code review process is central to our collaboration. Every contribution must go through a review before merging to maintain the quality of our codebase. As a contributor, being willing to discuss your work, respond to feedback, and work with the community is key to improving the project and creating a positive environment for all contributors.
