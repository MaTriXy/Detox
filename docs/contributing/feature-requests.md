# Feature Requests and Feedback

Open dialogue and feedback, particularly feature requests, play an invaluable role in open-source communities like Detox. They provide insights into user preferences and requirements, aiding in the refinement and enhancement of the project.

Detox project provides various platforms for feedback: [GitHub Issues], [GitHub Discussions], and [Discord].

Keep in mind that feedback is varied, including feature suggestions, improvements, identification of missing functionality, and support requests. Each type of feedback has a preferred method of submission.

## Crafting Effective Feedback

Follow these tips to deliver clear, actionable feedback:

- **Constructive Criticism:** Frame your feedback in a positive light, understanding the perspective of the project maintainers.
- **Comprehensive Details:** Include as much relevant information as possible to help maintainers understand the context and use case.
- **Clarity and Respect:** Make your feedback specific, clear, and respectful, ensuring it is actionable for the maintainers.
- **Guidelines:** Adhere to the below suggestions for each type of feedback.

## Feature Suggestions

When suggesting a new feature, remember to provide thorough information, such as examples, screenshots, and code snippets, to communicate your idea effectively.

## Crafting Effective Feature Requests

Just as in general feedback, make sure your feature request is:

- **Specific:** Clearly describe the feature you wish to see implemented.
- **Detailed:** Offer as much context as possible, including use cases, examples, and why this addition would benefit the community.
- **Respectful:** Remember, the project maintainers or contributors are not obligated to implement your request. Be polite and respectful in your request.

By making your feedback as clear and detailed as possible, you'll greatly assist the maintainers in understanding and potentially implementing your suggestion.
