# Detox Copilot

## Work in Progress

Detox Copilot is a Detox plugin that leverages large language models (LLM) to seamlessly invoke Detox actions.

It provides APIs to perform actions and assertions within your Detox tests while interfacing with an LLM service to enhance the testing process.

## Planned Core Features

- `act(prompt)`: Semantic action invocation, e.g. `copilot.act('tap the sign-in button')` 
- `expect(prompt)`: Semantic assertion invocation, e.g. `copilot.expect('the sign-in button is visible')`
